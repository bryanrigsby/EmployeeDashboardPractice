# EmployeeDashboardPractice

The goal of this project is to use HTML, CSS, and JS to build an dashboard where a company could see employee stats. Eventually this could evolve into an employee mgmt system having several pages and the ability to add/edit/delete employees. 

You will use bootstrap to help with styling and express for the server. 

Data will come from the js files under server/database. This will need to be exported into the server and retrieved from the frontend.
